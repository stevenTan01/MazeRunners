### statement of problem

Return the Boolean value of the statement â€œit is possible to get from the current position to the treasure."

### recursive abstraction
When I am asked to  </br>
  to determine the boolean value of the statement "it is possible to get from the current position to the treasure" </br>
the recursive abstraction can  </br>
  determine the boolean value of the statement "it is possible to get from one position over from the current position to the treasure" </br>

### base case
If you're on a treasure, return true  </br>
If you're on a wall, return false  </br>

### English or pseudocode description of algorithm
Check the current position for a base case solution</br>
If the current position of the explorer is a stepping stone, then record it as already being "used" <br>
Traverse one step towards a direction <br>
Invoke the recursive abstraction <br>
