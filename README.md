### statement of problem

Return the Boolean value of the statement â€œit is possible to get from the current position to the treasure."

### recursive abstraction
When I am asked to  </br>
  to determine the boolean value of the statement "it is possible to get from the starting position to the treasure" </br>
the recursive abstraction can  </br>
  determine the boolean value of the statement "it is possible to get from the current position to the treasure" </br>

### base case
If you're on a treasure, return true  </br>
If you're on a wall, return false  </br>


### English or pseudocode description of algorithm
If the current position of the explorer does not contain the treasure, then record it as a checkpoint. <br>
Traverse one step towards each of the four cardinal directions <br>
Invoke the recursive abstraction for each direction <br>
